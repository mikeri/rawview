# rawview
View 8 bit wide mono bitmaps, for example C64 fonts.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This tool was written to view C64 bitmap fonts. There is also an Amiga font loader and converter in progress. It's working on some 8x8 fonts but not all. It's very hackish at the moment.
=======
Can also view Amiga fonts (only 8x8 monospaced) and convert them to C64 format.
